	Both you and the dealer have two cards. You must decide whether to hit and receive another card or stay and wait for the dealer to do the same.
	<br></br>
	The aim of the game is to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without going over 21. You compute your score by adding the values of your individual cards.
	The cards 2 through 10 have their face value, J, Q, and K are worth 10 points each, and the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (player's choice).
