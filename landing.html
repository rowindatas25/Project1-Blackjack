		<h1>Classic Blackjack</h1>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21</li>
			<li>Face Cards(Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 and Aces are worth 1 or 11 depending on the player's score</li>
			<li>The player and dealer each start with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end</li>
			<li>To Hit is to ask for another card, to Stay is to hold your total and end your turn. </li>
			<li>If you go over 21 at any point, the dealer wins no matter what the dealer has</li>
			<li>If you are dealt 21 with your first two cards (Ace, 10), you got a Blackjack</li>
			<li>Blackjack means you earn 1.5 the amount of the bet you made</li>
			<li>The dealer will hit until their cards are 17 or higher</li>
			<li>To Double is like a Hit but the bet is doubled and you only receive one more card</li>
