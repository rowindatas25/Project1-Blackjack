# Project1-Blackjack

The technologies used in this project are vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. I built the cards in CSS and all the logic was done in javascript/

I took my time and built out each function that I needed. I made sure to test each one moving onto the next stage of the project. By naming everything as literal as possible, it was easier to see what I was using in different parts of my code. I used HTML and CSS to style the project, including a starter page that involves a classic blackjack theme.

There's one small bug with the game, if the dealer ends up with more than four cards then the player and deal cards end up overlapping with each other. 

There is also some added functionality in terms of being able to bet a money amount as well bet all the money remaining. This was done with numerous conditional statements and DOM manipulation.
