# Project1-Blackjack

The technologies used in this project are vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. I orginially intended to use jQuery as well but my execution of in within my code wasn't good so I decided to use the other three instead.

I tried to write numerous functions with Javascript in an Object Oriented style, they include creating the deck, players, card UI, player UI, keeping score, rendering the cards and others. I used HTML and CSS to style the project, including a starter page that involves a classic blackjack theme. In the end I wrote too many for loops and it mixed me up a little.

Unfortunately, there have been plenty of problems with the game due to my bad DOM manipuation and implementation of their classes in HTML. There were many moments where I thought I was appending elements to the DOM but they were sometimes not appearing in my HTML. There were also problems with scope which I think might have impacted the functionality of the game.

The functionality will need to be sorted out soon or the project won't be finished on time.
